### Dataset Download

We provide the frames and annotations.
- Frames: JPG format. The total size is 7.8GB. [[link]](/404.html)
- Annotations: JSON format. [[link]](/404.html)

The annotations are COCO-style, just like Youtube-VIS. So it's nearly cost-free to adapt your Youtube-VIS code for OVIS.

### Code

The code, models of the baseline method are released on [GitHub](https://github.com/qjy981010/OVIS).

The evaluation metric is the same as Youtube-VIS's, so you can use the evalution code provided by them [[link]](https://github.com/youtubevos/cocoapi)
